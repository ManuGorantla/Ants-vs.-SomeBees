Ants Vs. SomeBees is a Python-based tower defense game inspired by Plants vs. Zombies. In this game, players protect their ant colony from waves of attacking bees by strategically placing different types of ants, each with unique abilities, along the bees’ path. The ants vary in function—some gather resources, others deal damage, and some provide defensive support—allowing players to experiment with different strategies to fend off the bees. The game teaches key object-oriented programming concepts, as each ant and bee type is implemented as a class with specific behaviors, showcasing the power of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in a complex, interactive application.
